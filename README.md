# MyDailyReminder
My personal Android app to learn and showcase my skills

Start Date: 5/30/20

This will be an app I can continuously work on to keep up with latest Android trends and also to provide potential employers with actual code they can review.

Currently the idea is to create an app that sends users customizable reminders. This should allow me to learn the latest Android standards.

Things I plan on implementing/using:

Android Navigation

View/Data binding

Android notifications

Dagger2 or Hilt (Dependency Injection)

Retrofit (REST)

Room (Database Persistence)
